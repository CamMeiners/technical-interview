### Goal

Create a `create-react-app` that shows an index of "People" and "Planets" from the [Star Wars API](https://swapi.dev/). The indexes should display a grid of clickable cards that navigate to individual People and Planet view pages. On each individual People page, you should link to the `home` Planet, and on each Planet page link to each `resident` People page.

### Required tech to use

- create-react-app
- React Hooks
